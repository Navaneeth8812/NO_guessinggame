🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.
The program randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it with hints provided after each attempt.

📌 How the Game Works

The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The user is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the program responds with:

“a little less” if the guess is larger

“a little high” if the guess is smaller

The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

🧠 Concepts Used

Random number generation (random.randint)

Loops (while True)

Conditional statements (if / elif / else)

User input handling

Basic game logic
